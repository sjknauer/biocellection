Photobioreactor (PBR) system example 1. Solar energy is collected by a panel, which transmits energy to a bioreactor that contains algal organisms in solution tubing controlled by a chemostat. Gas exchange is permitted and the CO2 exhaust is bubbled through the reactor and circulates back into the system to enable photosynthesis. Another channel connecting to the bioreactor directs the algal solution into a filter for biomass. Wastewater used as growth media is recycled back into the bioreactor. After the biomass is collected, it can be used to serve 2 main purposes: either to undergo combustion to circulate the biofuel back to power the system or to be collected for the future extraction of valuable products.

PBR system example 2. This is a self-sufficient system powered by algae. The microorganisms are grown in vertical alveolar panels exposed to sunlight. Excess biomass is transferred via a sensory system into a converter, which undergoes combustion to transform the biomass into usable energy that can feed into a generator and then a battery. The power generated can go back into the combustion process which involves applying acid, temperature, and pressure. Producing heat and electricity, this process can serve as the secondary step to the first model above. With this system, we hope to revolutionize the potential of algal bioreactors as self-sufficient and individual based systems that can be scaled for industrial usage as a bioscrubber.
